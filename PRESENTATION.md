## Page 2: Problem Statement

# The Challenge We Identified

Small and medium-sized hospitals face critical operational inefficiencies:

- **Fragmented Record-Keeping** - Redundant patient records, inconsistent data, difficulty tracking history
- **Manual Appointment Scheduling** - Double-booking conflicts, no real-time availability, time-consuming coordination
- **Billing & Payment Errors** - Manual calculation mistakes, delayed invoices, poor payment tracking
- **Limited Visibility** - Unclear employee roles, poor resource allocation, inadequate coordination
- **Weak Inventory Control** - Stockouts, expired medication waste, no automated alerts

### Impact
- Increased operational costs
- Reduced patient satisfaction
- Compliance risks
- Staff frustration
- Financial losses
